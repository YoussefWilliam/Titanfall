## First 
Load these folders on this repo in your project, these folders contains the meta data needed so that this repo won't cause problems on cloning and working on the project on different devices

## Second 
These files also contains the Audio Manager, the Audio Manager is a prefab, whenever you want to add new sound, just go the Audio Manager prefab in your scene and increment the sound array, you will find an extra place added so you can add you sound, please be carreful you have to use the same name of the sound as C# is sensitive to this shit.
